## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Project From Udacity

## Sentiment Analysis

This is a project from a Udacity course on how to build a neural network to predict sentiment, positive or negative in movie reviews. 

## Contents

The course is separated in 6 mini projects:

- Mini Project 1 - Quick theory validation 
- Mini Project 2 - Creating the input/output Data
- Mini Project 3 - Building the neural network
- Mini Project 4 - Reducing the noise to make learning faster
- Mini Project 5 - Improving the efficiency of the network
- Mini Project 6 - Strategic noise reduction

## Methods and Frameworks utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - tool that allow the creation of documents with live code
- **Bag of Words & Word2vec** - methods for transforming text into vectors in order to be used as input in the network

## What you should already know

- neural networks, forward and back-propagation
- stochastic gradient descent
- mean squared error
- and train/test splits

## Installation

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and run the code below.

```
conda create --name sentiment_intro
source activate sentiment_intro
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```
